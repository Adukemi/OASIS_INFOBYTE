## 3: Data Cleaning

**Description**
This project involves refining a dataset by resolving issues such as missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formatting, and outliers. The data cleaning process ensures data integrity by addressing gaps, eliminating redundancies, standardizing formats, and managing anomalies. The objective is to prepare the dataset for reliable analysis and modeling.

**Key Insights**
- Missing Data Resolution: Managed missing values through imputation or removal to achieve a complete dataset.
- Duplicate Handling: Detected and removed duplicate entries to maintain data quality and uniqueness.
- Format Standardization: Harmonized the structure of categorical and numeric variables for consistent and accurate analysis.
- Outlier Management: Identified and handled outliers to minimize their impact on analytical results.
